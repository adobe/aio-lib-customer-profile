Limits the data fields to be included in the export to only those provided in this parameter. The same parameter is also available when creating a segment, therefore the fields in the segment may have already been filtered. Omitting this value will result in all fields being included in the exported data.\n* <strong>mergePolicy</strong> - [Optional] Specifies the merge policy to govern the exported data. Include this parameter when there are multiple segments being exported. Omitting this value will cause the Export Service to use the merge policy provided by the segmentId\n    * <strong>id</strong> - The ID of the merge policy.\n    * <strong>version</strong> - The specific version of the merge policy to use. Omitting this value will default to the most recent version.\n* <strong>filter</strong> - [Optional] Specifies one or more of the following filters to apply to the segment before export.\n    * <strong>segments</strong> - [Optional] Specifies the segments to export. Omitting this value will result in all data from all profiles being exported. Accepts an array of segment objects, each containing the following fields:\n        * <strong>segmentId</strong> - <strong>[Required if specifying segments]</strong> Segment ID for profiles to be exported.\n        * <strong>segmentNs</strong> - [Optional] Segment namespace for the given segmentId.\n        * <strong>status</strong> - [Optional] An array of strings providing a status filter for the `segmentID`. By default, `status` will have the value `[\"realized\", \"existing\"]` which represents all profiles that fall into the segment at the current time. Possible values include: `\"realized\"`, `\"existing\"`, and `\"exited\"`.\n    * <strong>segmentQualificationTime</strong> - [Optional] Filter based on segment qualification time. The start time and/or end time can be provided.\n        * <strong>startTime</strong> - [Optional] Segment qualification start time for a segment ID for a given status. It not provided, there will be no filter on the start time for a segment ID qualification. The timestamp must be provided in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format.\n        * <strong>endTime</strong> - [Optional] Segment qualification end time for a segment ID for a given status. It not provided, there will be no filter on the end time for a segment ID qualification. The timestamp must be provided in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format.\n    * <strong>fromIngestTimestamp</strong> - [Optional] Filters the resulting profiles to those that have been updated after the provided timestamp. Value is provided in RFC 3339 format. Supports `greater_than` operand.\n    * <strong>emptyProfiles</strong> - [Optional] Boolean. Profiles can contain Profile records, ExperienceEvent records, or both. Profiles with no Profile records and only ExperienceEvent records are referred to as \"emptyProfiles\". To export all profiles in the Profile store, including the \"emptyProfiles\", set the value of \"emptyProfiles\" to `true`. If \"emptyProfiles\" is set to `false`, only profiles with Profile records in the store are exported. By default, if \"emptyProfiles\" attribute is not included, only profiles containing Profile records are exported.\n* <strong>additionalFields</strong> - [Optional] Additional profile fields that need to be exported.\n    * <strong>eventList</strong> - Used if ExperienceEvents need to be exported with profiles.\n        * <strong>fields</strong> - Comma-separated list of ExperienceEvent fields to be included in the export. If not provided, all ExperienceEvent fields are exported.\n        * <strong>filter</strong> - Filters ExperienceEvents based on the parameters below. If not provided, all events corresponding to the resulting profiles will be exported.\n            * <strong>fromIngestTimestamp</strong> - Filters ExperienceEvents to those that have been updated after the provided timestamp. This is not the event time itself but the ingestion time for the events. Value is provided in RFC 3339 format.\n* <strong>destination</strong> - <strong>[Required]</strong> Destination information for the exported data.\n    * <strong>datasetId</strong> - <strong>[Required]</strong> The ID of the dataset where data is to be exported.\n    * <strong>segmentPerBatch</strong> [Optional] A Boolean value that, if not provided, defaults to false. A value of false exports all segment IDs into a single batch ID. A value of true exports one segment ID into one batch ID.\n* <strong>schema.name</strong> - <strong>[Required]</strong> The name of the schema associated with the dataset where data is to be exported.",

This action will delete ALL data for a given dataset. Experience Platform allows you to delete datasets based on both record and time series schemas.\n  \n  In order to delete a batch, the batch ID must be included in the body of the POST request. Please be advised that you cannot delete batches for datasets based on record schemas. Only batches for datasets based on time series schemas may be deleted. \n\n  **Note:** The reason you cannot delete batches for datasets based on record schemas is because record type dataset batches overwrite previous records and therefore cannot be \"undone\" or deleted. The way to remove the impact of erroneous batches for datasets based on record schemas is to reingest the batch with the correct data and it will overwrite the incorrect records. \n  \n  For more information on record and time series behavior, please review the section on XDM data behaviors in the [XDM System overview](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/home/xdm/xdmservices.html#!api-specification/markdown/narrative/technical_overview/schema_registry/xdm_system/xdm_system_in_experience_platform.md).",
